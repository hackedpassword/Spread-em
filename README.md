# 🚨🚨🚨 Mad Mapper alert 🚨🚨🚨

It was said spreading entities couldn't be done. Like fire, trees, water, tribbles, etc. 😵 This mod is a proof of concept that there is a way. It's not as clean or simple as a built-in unique.

The working concept uses units as a live terrain. More work needed to better control ignition, spread, and burnout. Good test runs have burned very realistically. A great test map is Britannia because there's swaths of forest. Normal mapgen even set to max vegetation and biome are still too open-clustered mosaic-y for a satisfying burn, forest swaths are the treat.

You might want to:
- spawn a Scout, it has Pyro ability
- either change Fire upkeep costs to zero or set Debug -> Supercharged
- set maximum vegetation and biome in random maps
