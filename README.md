# 🚨🚨🚨 Mad Mapper alert 🚨🚨🚨

It was said spreading entities couldn't be done. Like fire, trees, water, tribbles, etc. 😵

To be fair that's supposed to be right. I and others have tried before but low-hanging fruit in uniques wasn't going to do it. This repo represents about a 3rd or 4th try, each getting much more clever than the last.

This time, I recognized a connection in units - everything was right there, we were all looking at the obvious stuff, terrains/features, improvements, globals, no, this was not going to work, not possible. The end. ☹️

👊👊👊

I saw A Way. 🧐 The technique demonstrated here can assuredly be applied to other scenarios. I used fire as the demo. I'll circle back to the Antiyoy mod for use with trees. Remember you have to think differently about applying the spread using units, it doesn't work if you think about it in normal modding terms.

Also added Blaze which is kinda ok. Can't seem to get the AI to use it, lots of processing behavior and terrain-specific uniques fails, and without units being able to spawn automated, unit generation behaviors guide the spread organically. Improvements should be the key, doesn't work that way.

You might want to:
- spawn a Scout, it has Pyro ability
- either change Fire upkeep costs to zero or set Debug -> Supercharged
- set maximum vegetation and biome in random maps
